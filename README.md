# Decision Review System GUI App ‚öæüì∫

This is a Decision Review System GUI application developed using Python and Tkinter. The application simulates the Decision Review System (DRS) used in cricket to review the decisions made by on-field umpires.

## Features ‚ú®

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app provides a simple and intuitive GUI for users to interact with.
- **Video Playback**: Users can load and playback cricket videos.
- **Frame-by-Frame Analysis**: Analyze the video frame by frame to make accurate decisions.
- **Ball Tracking**: Visualize the path of the ball to determine LBW decisions.
- **Snickometer**: Detect edges using audio-visual signals to identify caught behinds.
- **Hotspot Technology**: Highlight ball impact points to assist in decision making.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the application.
- **Tkinter**: Python's standard GUI toolkit used to create the application interface.
- **OpenCV**: Library used for video processing and analysis.

## Installation üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yasheshoffgithub/Decision-Review-System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Decision-Review-System
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python, Pillow, numpy
    ```

## Usage üìñ

1. Run the application:
